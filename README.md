# Password-cracking-algorithms
All of the files and code is dependant on the passList.txt file except for brute force. The passList.txt file is also present in all programs
When ran separatly they ask for a user imput to set a password and then the program finds the password either through brute force or the dictionary search.
The MD5, SHA-256, and BCrypt all convert the password into a hash and all possible passwords into a hash and compares them to find the user entered password.
